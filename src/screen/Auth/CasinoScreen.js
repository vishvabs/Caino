       <Text style={styles.para}>888 Casino is one of the mainstays of online gaming. They have been operating since 1997 and are constantly updating their software to become a leader in the industry. Their current software can be downloaded and used on a web-based platform.</Text>
       <Text style={styles.para}>As an online casino player, you want to know that you will get the best bonuses and rewards. LeoVegas Casino is only the best in the store for all online casinos, Live Casino and Sportsbook players.</Text>

       <Text style={styles.para}>888 Casino claims to use RSA public / private key encryption technology to securely and securely transmit and store all data. Furthermore, all their transactions and personal information are stored on secure servers protected by advanced firewalls.</Text>

       <Text style={styles.para}>Let's find out if any of the first gaming sites have what you need. Anyway, I'll give it straight to you ... there's no rose glass here. Since cruelty is the name of the game, let's take a look at what 888 Casino has to offer!</Text>

       <Text style={styles.subheading}>General breakdown</Text>
       <Text style={styles.para}>888 Casino has a wide selection of high quality slots (personal favorites: including branded slots), most of which have amazing advanced jackpots. They offer a variety of constantly changing bonuses, some of which do not require savings to activate. Their Live Casino technology is amazing and their dealers create this experience from the comfort of their own home, just like a real casino. The lack of a live chat feature is a disappointment these days.</Text>

       <Text style={styles.subheading}>Various games</Text>
       <Text style={styles.para}>The variety of slot games is amazing and it was really nice to see so many familiar games that are always played in real casinos. This is the first thing to look for when checking out a new site. The choice of table games and video poker is unfortunately lacking. Thankfully, Live Casino has made up for some of the shortcomings in the Table Games section, but it would be nice to see more variety..</Text>

      
      

       <Text style={styles.subheading}>Banking operations</Text>
       <Text style={styles.para}>888 Casino has 15 ways to deposit money and 6 ways to withdraw money. Their minimum size is attractive, but they do not list the fees associated with placing and withdrawing money on your website. In the age of technology, the time it takes to get cash is longer than it takes. Withdrawals do not take more than a day or two to process, and some methods take 710 working days. They hope to work on reducing processing time in the near future.</Text>

    
    

       <Text style={styles.subheading}>Rewards</Text>
       <Text style={styles.para}>888 Casino promotions are easy to find and are well explained on the site. They do not challenge breaking the rules or winning prizes. There are even bonuses every day of the week, so you will get a bonus no matter when you make your next payment. One of the best registration bonuses I've ever seen that doesn't require a deposit to win real money.</Text>

       <Text style={styles.subheading}>Customer service</Text>
       <Text style={styles.para}>The only way to access their customer service is through the template in the "contact us" section of the website. There is no published email address, phone number or direct chat feature. That said, my question was answered accurately and in a timely manner.</Text>

       <Text style={styles.subheading}>User interface</Text>
       <Text style={styles.para}>I am very grateful for the organization of this website. The game options are all well-organized and easy to locate. They offer download and live play modes (using Flash). I really like websites that use web-based technology instead of downloading. My computer is slow enough to do this, so the last thing I want is to download another program. Live Casino web streaming is amazing and high quality. The only problem I had was that the Video Poker section was not easy to find. It is not included on the front pages of other game sections.</Text>

       <Text style={styles.subheading}>Game selection</Text>
       <Text style={styles.para}>888 Casino divides its casino games into 5 sections: Slots, Jackpots, Video Poker, Table Games and Live Casino. I like that they don't try to divide the game into too many categories, because it can be confused with too many categories. I've seen sites like Table Games and Card Games ... Where can you find Blackjack? It's a board game, a card game. So confuse. I like that 888 Casino doesn't try to be too complicated. It is easy to determine what can be found in each of these five categories. Now let's study them.</Text>

       <Text style={styles.subheading}>Slots</Text>
       <Text style={styles.para}>One of the biggest features of 888casino is how many slots you can recognize. Not only are there 51 slots to choose from, but most of them will be familiar to you when you visit a brick-and-mortar casino. This is my number one selling feature among reliable and reputable sites. I want to have a website where I can play my favorite casino games at home.</Text>

       <Text style={styles.para}>To add a great selection and familiar games, 888casino has several brands of slots. This is also what you are looking for on gaming sites. I would rather play a KISS game with the real Jen Simmons than with Jim Simmonds. What can I say, I don't see Jim Simmonds as charismatic as Gene alone.</Text>

       <Text style={styles.para}>If you are looking for a site with your favorite game, feel free to publish this articleGet the latest offers from the site.</Text>

       <Text style={styles.para}>The main site has a very simple style with noticeable graphics and game details. The mobile site has the largest graphics cards we've found, so even the latest online gamers will be happy to make their choice without having to worry about making mistakes. The casino is available with Instant Play or Download options.</Text>

       <Text style={styles.heading}>Jackpots</Text>
       <Text style={styles.para}>Of the 51 slot games mentioned above, 10 are jackpot games. At the time of writing, jackpot prices range from $ 45,806.91 to $ 4,145,982.22. 10 jackpot games are:</Text>


       
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Diamonds Delight ($ 45,806.91) </Text>
   
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>The rise of the Pharaohs ($ 4,145,982.22) </Text>
       
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Jax Pot ($ 92,279.83) </Text>
       
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Sayatan Gini ($ 4,145,982.22)</Text>
       
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Treasure Show ($ 450,687.38) </Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Wealth of Ireland ($ 4,145,982.22)</Text>
   
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Millions of Pirates ($ 4,145,982.22) </Text>
       
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Gods of Gold ($ 450,687.38) </Text>
       
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Santa's Super Nest ($ 4,145,982.22) </Text>
       
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>A Nightmare on Elm Street ($ 45,815.57) </Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Video poker </Text>
       


       <Text style={styles.para}>At first I thought 888casino didn't offer video poker. It is not included in the tabs at the top of the screen, along with other categories. I was very surprised that it was not offered, so I asked for their customer support via "Contact Us". I received a reply that I needed to click on the "Casino Game" button in the upper left corner of the front page. It has a separate menu with 5 categories: Slots, Roulette, Blackjack, Baccarat and Video Poker. Slots, roulette, and blackjack tabs took me to the same games as the individual tabs on the home page, but Baccarat and Video Poker are nowhere to be found on the home page. It's weird, but at least I recommend them ... you need to do a little extra search.</Text>

       <Text style={styles.para}>With only 4 video poker game options, 888 Casino does not have enough video poker options. I want to watch at least 10 video poker games, especially Double Double Bonus and Triple Double Bonus. None of these games are available at 888 Casino. According to the website, video poker is one of the most popular games in the casino industry, so I'm disappointed to see that there is no other option. There are 4 video poker games available:</Text>

       
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>All American double</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Jack or better</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Joker Wild Double Up</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Deuces Wild Double Up</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}></Text>
      


       <Text style={styles.heading}>Board games</Text>
       <Text style={styles.para}>888 Casino has 8 types of table games. I was hoping to see more options on their table games, especially considering the options they offer in slot games. This section lacks games such as Caribbean Stud, Pai Gow, Three Card Poker, and Let It Ride. They just seem to follow the classic board games, which limits the choice considerably. However, since these are the most popular table games in casinos, it is clear that most players are interested in these games.</Text>
       <Text style={styles.cheading}>Available 8 board games:</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>European roulette</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Black in many hands</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>American roulette</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>American Black</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>3D roulette</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Classic black</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Low stakes roulette</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>French roulette</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}></Text>


       <Text style={styles.para}>You will notice that these 8 games are versions of two games: roulette and blackjack. There are no uncommon table games, and there are no craps tables. It would be an understatement to say that they were disappointed with their choice of board game.</Text>

       <Text style={styles.subheading}>Live casino</Text>
       <Text style={styles.para}>Live Casino 888 Casino is the place where the rest of the table game category takes its toll. Although there are only 8 games in this section (this site likes 8!), There are more types in this section than in board games. From each of these games, there are a variety of table options for each game, which means you'll always find a table that suits your needs ... if you're unlucky at one table, you can pick up your chips and go to the table. The side door, just like in a real casino! Here are 8 games offered at direct casinos:</Text>

      
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Amd Baccarat</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Live Blackjack</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Live Caribbean Stud Poker</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Live roulette</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Live three card poker</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Live Casino Hold'em</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>Live Ultimate Texas Hold'em</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}>888 Casino Live Elite Lounge (offers high limit exclusive roulette and blackjack tables)</Text>
       <Text style={styles.csubheading}></Text>

       <Text style={styles.para}>According to the website, Live Casino allows you to choose your favorite table games of all time and the most professional live dealers you will ever meet. That's a big promise, but the impression of the dealers I've played with is that they keep that promise. Dealers greet you by username when you join the table and answer questions in real time from the chat box. It's like playing in a real casino, except when you're comfortable at home! This is definitely a great feature I liked.</Text>

       <Text style={styles.subheading}>Rewards</Text>
       <Text style={styles.para}>When it comes to promotions, 888 Casino does it right. They are easy to find using the "Promotions" tab at the top of each screen, and there are a wide variety of bonuses for new and existing players. This will allow everyone to advance to a position that suits their needs or find two (or five!). Who doesn't love free money?</Text>


       <Text style={styles.subheading}>Welcome bonus offers</Text>
       <Text style={styles.para}>888 Casino has a welcome bonus offer that will pay you 100% of your initial deposit up to $ 200. So if you deposit $ 100, you will have $ 200 to play in your account. The best part of this promotion is that 888 Casino will let you know little by little over time does not receive compensation. You will get all your money right at the checkout ... welcome!</Text>
